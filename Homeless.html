    <h2>How do I stay safe and healthy?</h2>
    <!-- \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ -->
    
    <p>Some good advice for staying safe and healthy can also be found at <a href='https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-homeless-living-and-survival-hacks'>"What are the best homeless living and survival hacks?"</a> on Quora. Advice such as:</p>
    
    <li>Use bridges and underpasses for cold protection.</li>

    <li>Remember that phones can call 911, even if they have no service.</li>

    <p>Quora isn't the only source of advice, however. Other advice from various locations on the internet includes:</p>
    
    <li>Avoid sleeping in dumpsters. Many homeless people die from dump trucks picking up the dumpsters and emptying them.</li>
    <li>Use wet wipes to clean yourself if you can't get a shower.</li>
    <li>Avoid drug abuse by keeping yourself distracted through doing something like exercising.</li>
    <li>Use canned beans as a source of cheap protien.</li>
    <li>Wear sunscreen if you must stay in direct sun rays. You'll eventually get skin cancer if you don't.</li>
    <li>Eat healthy foods and drink clean water. Prioritize real food over junk food, drink clean water instead of soda, and so on.</li>
    <li>Consider moving around if you are homeless and live in a dangerous area. Do not stay in places that experience snow, tornadoes, flash floods, hurricanes, and so on.</li>
    <li>Buy a solar powered flashlight and a handcrank emergency radio.</li>
    <li>Travel light, store valuables where they are least likely to be stolen, and carry only what you really need, such as ID, documents, a pen, etc.</li>
    <li>Learn soup kitchen schedules and menus. Carry high-protien food with you when you go to one.</li>
    <li>Know your rights, and know how the police behave in your area. Be polite and calm to police officers.</li>
