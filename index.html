				<h1>What is this?</h1>
				<p>This website intends to serve as a useful tool for homeless people themselves. It provides advice for the homeless like tips on how to survive in a cold night and a link to a directory for homeless shelters. We also provide tips for ways to stay healthy.</p>
				
				
				<h3>What is the Homeless Directory?</h3>
				<p>The Homeless Shelter Directory provides Homeless Shelters and Homeless Service Organizations. The directory was created for people who want to find and donate food and/or supplies to their local shelter.</p>
                
                <p id='fortune'>Your randomly generated homeless fact will go here.</p>
